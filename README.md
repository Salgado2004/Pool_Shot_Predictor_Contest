<p align="justify">Programming contest hosted by CV Zone, sponsored by <a href="https://www.computervision.zone/?ns_url=1Zy&mid=9916343"><b>NVIDIA</b></a>. Where the objective is to <b>predict the paths of the ball on the pool table and whether they will go in the hole</b>. </p>

<p align="justify">The main method used is color and shape detection to discern the objects on the pool table. To each object, the program defines a different HSV filter. With the coordinates of each object, it calculates the likely path of the ball based on linear algebra.</p>

<p align="justify">It has been defined labels in front of the objects, to help me understand what the program was detecting during the development. Later on, I decided to keep them just for style.</p>
